== LDAP Result Codes

An operation result code as defined in RFC 4511 section 4.1.9 is used to indicate the final status of an operation. If a server detects multiple errors for an operation, only one result code is returned. The server should return the result code that best indicates the nature of the error encountered. Servers may return substituted result codes to prevent unauthorized disclosures.

|===
|Result Code |Name |Description 

a|-1
a|Undefined
a|The result code that should only be used if the actual result code has not yet been determined. Despite not being a standard result code, it is an implementation of the null object design pattern for this type.

a|0
a|Success
a|The result code that indicates that the operation completed successfully.

a|1
a|Operations Error
a|The result code that indicates that an internal error prevented the operation from being processed properly.

a|2
a|Protocol Error
a|The result code that indicates that the client sent a malformed or illegal request to the server.

a|3
a|Time Limit Exceeded
a|The result code that indicates that a time limit was exceeded while attempting to process the request.

a|4
a|Size Limit Exceeded
a|The result code that indicates that a size limit was exceeded while attempting to process the request.

a|5
a|Compare False
a|The result code that indicates that the attribute value assertion included in a compare request did not match the targeted entry.

a|6
a|Compare True
a|The result code that indicates that the attribute value assertion included in a compare request did match the targeted entry.

a|7
a|Authentication Method Not Supported
a|The result code that indicates that the requested authentication attempt failed because it referenced an invalid SASL mechanism.

a|8
a|Strong Authentication Required
a|The result code that indicates that the requested operation could not be processed because it requires that the client has completed a strong form of authentication.

a|10
a|Referral
a|The result code that indicates that a referral was encountered. Strictly speaking this result code should not be exceptional since it is considered as a "success" response. However, referrals should occur rarely in practice and, when they do occur, should not be ignored since the application may believe that a request has succeeded when, in fact, nothing was done.

a|11
a|Administrative Limit Exceeded
a|The result code that indicates that processing on the requested operation could not continue because an administrative limit was exceeded.

a|12
a|Unavailable Critical Extension
a|The result code that indicates that the requested operation failed because it included a critical extension that is unsupported or inappropriate for that request.

a|13
a|Confidentiality Required
a|The result code that indicates that the requested operation could not be processed because it requires confidentiality for the communication between the client and the server.

a|14
a|SASL Bind in Progress
a|The result code that should be used for intermediate responses in multi-stage SASL bind operations.

a|16
a|No Such Attribute
a|The result code that indicates that the requested operation failed because it targeted an attribute or attribute value that did not exist in the specified entry.

a|17
a|Undefined Attribute Type
a|The result code that indicates that the requested operation failed because it referenced an attribute that is not defined in the server schema.

a|18
a|Inappropriate Matching
a|The result code that indicates that the requested operation failed because it attempted to perform an inappropriate type of matching against an attribute.

a|19
a|Constraint Violation
a|The result code that indicates that the requested operation failed because it would have violated some constraint defined in the server.

a|20
a|Attribute or Value Exists
a|The result code that indicates that the requested operation failed because it would have resulted in a conflict with an existing attribute or attribute value in the target entry.

a|21
a|Invalid Attribute Syntax
a|The result code that indicates that the requested operation failed because it violated the syntax for a specified attribute.

a|32
a|No Such Entry
a|The result code that indicates that the requested operation failed because it referenced an entry that does not exist.

a|33
a|Alias Problem
a|The result code that indicates that the requested operation failed because it attempted to perform an illegal operation on an alias.

a|34
a|Invalid DN Syntax
a|The result code that indicates that the requested operation failed because it would have resulted in an entry with an invalid or malformed DN.

a|Alias Dereferencing Problem
a|The result code that indicates that a problem was encountered while attempting to dereference an alias for a search operation.
