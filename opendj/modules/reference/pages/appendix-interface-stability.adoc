== Release Levels and Interface Stability

This appendix includes Open Identity Platform definitions for product release levels and interface stability:
In addition to the indications concerning interface stability in the documentation, review the following information about OpenDJ user and application programming interfaces.

* Client tools—`ldap*`, `ldif*`, and `*rate` commands—are Evolving.

* The following classes, interfaces, and methods in the link:../javadoc/index.html[OpenDJ APIs, window=\_blank] are Evolving:
+

** `org.forgerock.opendj.ldap.Connections#newInternalConnection`

** `org.forgerock.opendj.ldap.Connections#newInternalConnectionFactory`

** `org.forgerock.opendj.ldap.Connections#newServerConnectionFactory`

** `org.forgerock.opendj.ldap.FutureResult`

** `org.forgerock.opendj.ldap.LDAPClientContext`

** `org.forgerock.opendj.ldap.LDAPListener`

** `org.forgerock.opendj.ldap.LDAPListenerOptions`

** `org.forgerock.opendj.ldap.MemoryBackend`

** `org.forgerock.opendj.ldap.RequestContext`

** `org.forgerock.opendj.ldap.RequestHandler`

** `org.forgerock.opendj.ldap.RequestHandlerFactory`

** `org.forgerock.opendj.ldap.ServerConnection`

** `org.forgerock.opendj.ldap.ServerConnectionFactory`


* The following classes and interfaces in the OpenDJ LDAP SDK APIs are Evolving:
+

** `org.forgerock.opendj.ldap.ConnectionSecurityLayer`

** `org.forgerock.opendj.ldap.LDAPUrl`

** `org.forgerock.opendj.ldap.requests.BindRequest`, including sub-types and especially SASL sub-types

** `org.forgerock.opendj.ldap.schema.MatchingRuleImpl`

** `org.forgerock.opendj.ldap.schema.SchemaValidationPolicy`

** `org.forgerock.opendj.ldap.schema.SyntaxImpl`


* The following methods are Deprecated:
+

** `org.forgerock.opendj.ldap.Connections#newHeartBeatConnectionFactory`

** `org.forgerock.opendj.ldap.LDAPListenerOptions#getTCPNIOTransport`

** `org.forgerock.opendj.ldap.LDAPListenerOptions#setTCPNIOTransport`

** `org.forgerock.opendj.ldap.LDAPOptions#getTCPNIOTransport`

** `org.forgerock.opendj.ldap.LDAPOptions#setTCPNIOTransport`


* The class `org.forgerock.opendj.ldap.CoreMessages` is Internal.

* For all Java APIs, `com.*` packages are Internal.

* The configuration, user, and application programming interfaces for RESTful access over HTTP to directory data are Evolving. This includes interfaces exposed for the HTTP connection handler, its access log, and also the REST to LDAP gateway.

* Text in log messages should be considered Internal. Log message IDs are Evolving.

* The default content of `cn=schema` (directory server LDAP schema) is Evolving.

* The monitoring interface `cn=monitor` for LDAP and the monitoring interface exposed by the JMX connection handler are Evolving.

* Interfaces that are not described in released product documentation should be considered Internal/Undocumented. For example, the LDIF representation of the server configuration, `config.ldif`, should be considered Internal.
