== Name
makeldif-template â€” template file for the make-ldif command

== Synopsis

[source]
----
# Comment lines start with #.
#
# Notice that this synopsis includes blank lines after entries.
# In the same way you would use blank lines after entries in normal LDIF,
# leave empty lines after "entries" in template files.

# Optionally include classes that define custom tags.
# Custom tag classes extend org.opends.server.tools.makeldif.Tag and
# must be on the class path when you run make-ldif.
#
include custom.makeldif.tag.ClassName
...

# Optionally define constants used in the template.
# To reference constants later, put brackets around the name: [constant-name]
#
define constant-name=value
...

# Define branches by suffix DN, such as the following:
#
#  dc=example,dc=com
#  ou=People,dc=example,dc=com
#  ou=Groups,dc=example,dc=com
#
# make-ldif generates the necessary object class definitions and RDNs.
#
# A branch can have subordinateTemplates that define templates to use for
# the branch entry.
#
# A branch can have additional attributes generated on the branch entry. See
# the Description below for more information on specifying attribute values.

# Define entries using templates.
#
# A template can extend another template.
# A template defines the RDN attribute(s) used for generated entries.
# A template can have a subordinateTemplate that defines a template to use for
# the generated entries.
#
# A template then defines attributes. See the Description below for more
# information on specifying attribute values.

== Description
Template files specify how to build LDIF. They allow you to define variables, insert random values from other files, and generally build arbitrarily large LDIF files for testing purposes. You pass template files to the `make-ldif` command when generating LDIF.

The Synopsis above shows the layout for a `make-ldif` template file. This section focuses on what you can do to specify entry attribute values, called __attr-value__ in the Synopsis section.
.Specifying Attribute Values
--
When specifying attribute values in `make-ldif` templates, you can use static text and constants that you have defined, enclosing names for constants in brackets, `[myConstant]`. You can use more than one constant per line, as in the following example.

[source, ldif]
----
description: Description for [org] under [suffix]
----
You can also use two kinds of tags when specifying attribute values. One kind of tag gets replaced with the value of another attribute in the generated entry. Such tags are delimited with braces, `{ }`. For example, if your template includes definitions for first name and last name attributes:

[source, ldif]
----
givenName: <first>
sn: <last>
----
Then you can define a mail attribute that uses the values of both attributes, and an initials attribute that takes the first character of each.

[source, ldif]
----
mail: {givenName}.{sn}@[myDomain]
initials: {givenName:1}{sn:1}
----
The other kind of tag is delimited with `<` and `>`, as shown above in the example with `<first>` and `<last>`. Tag names are not case sensitive. Many tags can take arguments separated by colons, `:`, from the tag names within the tag.

Use backslashes to escape literal start tag characters (`< [ {`) as shown in the following example, and to escape literal end tag characters within tags (`> ] }`).

[source, ldif]
----
scimMail: \{"emails": \[\{"value": "{mail}", "type": "work", "primary": true}]}
xml: \<id>{uid}\</id>
----
OpenDJ supports the following tags.

<DN>::
The DN tag gets replaced by the distinguished name of the current entry. An optional integer argument specifies the subcomponents of the DN to generate. For example, if the DN of the entry is `uid=bjensen,ou=People,dc=example,dc=com` `<DN:1>` gets replaced by `uid=bjensen`, and `<DN:-2>` gets replaced by `dc=example,dc=com`.

<File>::
The File tag gets replaced by a line from a text file you specify. The File tag takes a required argument, the path to the text file, and an optional second argument, either `random` or `sequential`. For the file argument, either you specify an absolute path to the file such as `<file:/path/to/myDescriptions>`, or you specify a path relative to the `/path/to/opendj/config/MakeLDIF/` directory such as `<file:streets>`. For the second argument, if you specify `sequential` then lines from the file are read in sequential order. Otherwise, lines from the file are read in random order.

<First>::
The first name tag gets replaced by a random line from `/path/to/opendj/config/MakeLDIF/first.names`. Combinations of generated first and last names are unique, with integers appended to the name strings if not enough combinations are available.

<GUID>::
The GUID tag gets replaced by a 128-bit, type 4 (random) universally unique identifier such as `f47ac10b-58cc-4372-a567-0e02b2c3d479`.

<IfAbsent>::
The IfAbsent tag takes as its first argument the name of another attribute, and optionally as its second argument a value to use. This tag causes the attribute to be generated only if the named attribute is not present on the generated entry. Use this tag when you have used `<Presence>` to define another attribute that is not always present on generated entries.

<IfPresent>::
The IfPresent takes as its first argument the name of another attribute, and optionally as its second argument a value to use. This tag causes the attribute to be generated only if the named attribute is also present on the generated entry. Use this tag when you have used `<Presence>` to define another attribute that is sometimes present on generated entries.

<Last>::
The last name tag gets replaced by a random line from `/path/to/opendj/config/MakeLDIF/last.names`. Combinations of generated first and last names are unique, with integers appended to the name strings if not enough combinations are available.

<List>::
The List tag gets replaced by one of the values from the list of arguments you provide. For example, `<List:bronze:silver:gold>` gets replaced with `bronze`, `silver`, or `gold`.

+
You can weight arguments to ensure some arguments are selected more often than others. For example, if you want two bronze for one silver and one gold, use `<List:bronze;2:silver;1:gold;1>`.

<ParentDN>::
The ParentDN tag gets replaced by the distinguished name of the parent entry. For example, if the DN of the entry is `uid=bjensen,ou=People,dc=example,dc=com`, `<ParentDN>` gets replaced by `ou=People,dc=example,dc=com`.

<Presence>::
The Presence tag takes a percent argument. It does not get replaced by a value itself, but instead results in the attribute being generated on the percentage of entries you specify in the argument. For example, `description: <Presence:50>A description` generates `description: A description` on half the entries.

<Random>::
The Random tag lets you generate a variety of random numbers and strings. The Random tag has the following subtypes, which you include as arguments, that is `<Random:subtype>`.
+

* `alpha:length`

* `alpha:minlength:maxlength`

* `numeric:length`

* `numeric:minvalue:maxvalue`

* `numeric:minvalue:maxvalue:format`, where __format__ is a link:http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/text/DecimalFormat.html[java.text.DecimalFormat, window=\_blank] pattern

* `alphanumeric:length`

* `alphanumeric:minlength:maxlength`

* `chars:characters:length`

* `chars:characters:minlength:maxlength`

* `hex:length`

* `hex:minlength:maxlength`

* `base64:length`

* `base64:minlength:maxlength`

* `month`

* `month:maxlength`

* `telephone`, a telephone number starting with the country code `+1`


<RDN>::
The RDN tag gets replaced with the RDN of the entry. Use this in the template after you have specified `rdnAttr` so that the RDN has already been generated when this tag is replaced.

+
An optional integer argument specifies the subcomponents of the RDN to generate.

<Sequential>::
The Sequential tag gets replaced by a sequentially increasing generated integer. The first optional integer argument specifies the starting number. The second optional boolean argument specifies whether to start over when generating entries for a new parent entry. For example, `<Sequential>:42:true` starts counting from 42, and starts over when the parent entry changes from `o=Engineering` to `o=Marketing`.

<_DN>::
The _DN tag gets replaced by the DN of the current entry with underscores in the place of commas.

<_ParentDN>::
The _ParentDN tag gets replaced by the DN the parent entry with underscores in the place of commas.
