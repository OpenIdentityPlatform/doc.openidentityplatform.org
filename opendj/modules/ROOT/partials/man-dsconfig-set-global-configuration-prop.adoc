Assigns a value to a property where PROP is the name of the property and VALUE is the single value to be assigned. Specify the same property multiple times in order to assign more than one value to it.
+
Global Configuration properties depend on the Global Configuration type, which depends on the null option.

Global Configuration properties depend on the Global Configuration type, which depends on the null option.

`--add {PROP:VALUE}`::

+
Global Configuration properties depend on the Global Configuration type, which depends on the null option.

`--remove {PROP:VALUE}`::

Removes a single value from a property where PROP is the name of the property and VALUE is the single value to be removed.

Global Configurations of type global have the following properties:

--

Default Value::
false


Allowed Values::
true
false


Multi-valued::
No

Required::
No

Admin Action Required::
None

Advanced Property::
Yes (Use --advanced in interactive mode.)

A String


Multi-valued::
Yes

Required::
No

====

bind-with-dn-requires-password::
[open]
====
Description::
Indicates whether the directory server should reject any simple bind request that contains a DN but no password.

Default Value::
true


Allowed Values::
true
false


Multi-valued::
No

Required::
No

Admin Action Required::
None

Advanced Property::
No

Read-only::

check-schema::
[open]
====
Description::
Indicates whether schema enforcement is active.

true


Allowed Values::
true
false


Multi-valued::
No

Required::
No

This property must reference a password policy and no other type of authentication policy.
