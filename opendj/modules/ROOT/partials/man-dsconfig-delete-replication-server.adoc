[#dsconfig-delete-replication-server-replication-server]
== Replication Server

Replication Servers of type replication-server have the following properties:

--


assured-timeout::
[open]
====
Description::
The timeout value when waiting for assured mode acknowledgments. Defines the number of milliseconds that the replication server will wait for assured acknowledgments (in either Safe Data or Safe Read assured sub modes) before forgetting them and answer to the entity that sent an update and is waiting for acknowledgment.


Default Value::
1000ms


Allowed Values::
<xinclude:include href="itemizedlist-duration.xml" />
Lower limit is 1 milliseconds.


Multi-valued::
No

Required::
No

Admin Action Required::
None

Advanced Property::
No

Read-only::
No


====

cipher-key-length::
[open]
====
Description::
Specifies the key length in bits for the preferred cipher. 


Default Value::
128


Allowed Values::
An integer value. Lower value is 0.


Multi-valued::
No

Required::
No

Admin Action Required::
NoneChanges to this property take effect immediately but only affect cryptographic operations performed after the change.

Advanced Property::
No

Read-only::
No


====

cipher-transformation::
[open]
====
Description::
Specifies the cipher for the directory server. The syntax is &quot;algorithm/mode/padding&quot;. The full transformation is required: specifying only an algorithm and allowing the cipher provider to supply the default mode and padding is not supported, because there is no guarantee these default values are the same among different implementations. Some cipher algorithms, including RC4 and ARCFOUR, do not have a mode or padding, and hence must be specified using NONE for the mode field and NoPadding for the padding field. For example, RC4/NONE/NoPadding.


Default Value::
AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding


Allowed Values::
A String


Multi-valued::
No

Required::
No

Admin Action Required::
NoneChanges to this property take effect immediately but only affect cryptographic operations performed after the change.

Advanced Property::
No

Read-only::
No


====

compute-change-number::
[open]
====
Description::
Whether the replication server will compute change numbers. This boolean tells the replication server to compute change numbers for each replicated change by maintaining a change number index database. Changenumbers are computed according to http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-good-ldap-changelog-04. Note this functionality has an impact on CPU, disk accesses and storage. If changenumbers are not required, it is advisable to set this value to false.


Default Value::
true


Allowed Values::
true
false


Multi-valued::
No

Required::
No

Admin Action Required::
None

Advanced Property::
No

Read-only::
No


====

confidentiality-enabled::
[open]
====
Description::
Indicates whether the replication change-log should make records readable only by Directory Server. Throughput and disk space are affected by the more expensive operations taking place. Confidentiality is achieved by encrypting records on all domains managed by this replication server. Encrypting the records prevents unauthorized parties from accessing contents of LDAP operations. For complete protection, consider enabling secure communications between servers. Change number indexing is not affected by the setting.


Default Value::
false


Allowed Values::
true
false


Multi-valued::
No

Required::
No

Admin Action Required::
NoneChanges to this property take effect immediately but only affect operations performed after the change.

Advanced Property::
No

Read-only::
No


====

degraded-status-threshold::
[open]
====
Description::
The number of pending changes as threshold value for putting a directory server in degraded status. This value represents a number of pending changes a replication server has in queue for sending to a directory server. Once this value is crossed, the matching directory server goes in degraded status. When number of pending changes goes back under this value, the directory server is put back in normal status. 0 means status analyzer is disabled and directory servers are never put in degraded status.


Default Value::
5000


Allowed Values::
An integer value. Lower value is 0.


Multi-valued::
No

Required::
No

Admin Action Required::
None

Advanced Property::
No

Read-only::
No


====

group-id::
[open]
====
Description::
The group id for the replication server. This value defines the group id of the replication server. The replication system of a LDAP server uses the group id of the replicated domain and tries to connect, if possible, to a replication with the same group id.


Default Value::
1


Allowed Values::
An integer value. Lower value is 1. Upper value is 127.


Multi-valued::
No

Required::
No

Admin Action Required::
None

Advanced Property::
No

Read-only::
No


====

monitoring-period::
[open]
====
Description::
The period between sending of monitoring messages. Defines the duration that the replication server will wait before sending new monitoring messages to its peers (replication servers and directory servers). Larger values increase the length of time it takes for a directory server to detect and switch to a more suitable replication server, whereas smaller values increase the amount of background network traffic.


Default Value::
60s


Allowed Values::
<xinclude:include href="itemizedlist-duration.xml" />
Lower limit is 0 milliseconds.


Multi-valued::
No

Required::
No

Admin Action Required::
None

Advanced Property::
No

Read-only::
No


====

queue-size::

Default Value::
10000


Allowed Values::
An integer value. Lower value is 0.

====

replication-server::
[open]
====
Description::
Specifies the addresses of other Replication Servers to which this Replication Server tries to connect at startup time. Addresses must be specified using the syntax: &quot;hostname:port&quot;. If IPv6 addresses are used as the hostname, they must be specified using the syntax &quot;[IPv6Address]:port&quot;.

====

weight::
[open]
====
Description::
The weight of the replication server. The weight affected to the replication server. Each replication server of the topology has a weight. When combined together, the weights of the replication servers of a same group can be translated to a percentage that determines the quantity of directory servers of the topology that should be connected to a replication server. For instance imagine a topology with 3 replication servers (with the same group id) with the following weights: RS1=1, RS2=1, RS3=2. This means that RS1 should have 25% of the directory servers connected in the topology, RS2 25%, and RS3 50%. This may be useful if the replication servers of the topology have a different power and one wants to spread the load between the replication servers according to their power.


Default Value::
1


Allowed Values::
An integer value. Lower value is 1.


Multi-valued::

Admin Action Required::
None
