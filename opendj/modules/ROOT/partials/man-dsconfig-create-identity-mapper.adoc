== Name
dsconfig create-identity-mapper - Creates Identity Mappers

== Synopsis

`dsconfig create-identity-mapper` {options}

[#dsconfig-create-identity-mapper-description]
== Description

Creates Identity Mappers.



[#dsconfig-create-identity-mapper-options]
== Options

The `dsconfig create-identity-mapper` command takes the following options:

--
`--mapper-name {name}`::

The name of the new Identity Mapper.
+

[open]
====
Identity Mapper properties depend on the Identity Mapper type, which depends on the {name} you provide.

By default, OpenDJ directory server supports the following Identity Mapper types:

`exact-match-identity-mapper`::
+
Default {name}: Exact Match Identity Mapper
+
Enabled by default: true
+
See  <<dsconfig-create-identity-mapper-exact-match-identity-mapper>> for the properties of this Identity Mapper type.
`regular-expression-identity-mapper`::
+
Default {name}: Regular Expression Identity Mapper
+
Enabled by default: true
+
See  <<dsconfig-create-identity-mapper-regular-expression-identity-mapper>> for the properties of this Identity Mapper type.
====

`--set {PROP:VALUE}`::

Assigns a value to a property where PROP is the name of the property and VALUE is the single value to be assigned. Specify the same property multiple times in order to assign more than one value to it.
+
Identity Mapper properties depend on the Identity Mapper type, which depends on the `--mapper-name {name}` option.

`-t | --type {type}`::

The type of Identity Mapper which should be created. The value for TYPE can be one of: custom | exact-match | regular-expression.
