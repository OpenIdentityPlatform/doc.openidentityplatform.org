== Name
dsconfig create-backend-index - Creates Backend Indexes

== Synopsis

`dsconfig create-backend-index` {options}

[#dsconfig-create-backend-index-description]
== Description

Creates Backend Indexes.



[#dsconfig-create-backend-index-options]
== Options

The `dsconfig create-backend-index` command takes the following options:

--
`--backend-name {name}`::

The name of the Pluggable Backend.
+

[open]
====
Backend Index properties depend on the Backend Index type, which depends on the {name} you provide.

By default, OpenDJ directory server supports the following Backend Index types:

`backend-index`::
+
Default {name}: Backend Index
+
Enabled by default: false
+
See  <<dsconfig-create-backend-index-backend-index>> for the properties of this Backend Index type.
====

`--index-name {OID}`::

The name of the new Backend Index which will also be used as the value of the "attribute" property: Specifies the name of the attribute for which the index is to be maintained.
+

[open]
====
Backend Index properties depend on the Backend Index type, which depends on the {OID} you provide.

By default, OpenDJ directory server supports the following Backend Index types:

`backend-index`::
+
Default {OID}: Backend Index
+
Enabled by default: false
+
See  <<dsconfig-create-backend-index-backend-index>> for the properties of this Backend Index type.
====

`--set {PROP:VALUE}`::

Assigns a value to a property where PROP is the name of the property and VALUE is the single value to be assigned. Specify the same property multiple times in order to assign more than one value to it.
+
Backend Index properties depend on the Backend Index type, which depends on the `--index-name {OID}` option.

== Backend Index

Backend Indexes of type backend-index have the following properties:

--


attribute::
[open]
====
Description::
Specifies the name of the attribute for which the index is to be maintained. 


Default Value::
None


Allowed Values::
The name of an attribute type defined in the server schema.


Multi-valued::
No

Required::
Yes

Admin Action Required::
None

Advanced Property::
No

Read-only::
Yes


====

confidentiality-enabled::
[open]
====
Description::
Specifies whether contents of the index should be confidential. Setting the flag to true will hash keys for equality type indexes using SHA-1 and encrypt the list of entries matching a substring key for substring indexes.


Default Value::
false


Allowed Values::
true
false


Multi-valued::
No

Required::
No

Admin Action Required::
If the index for the attribute must be protected for security purposes and values for that attribute already exist in the database, the index must be rebuilt before it will be accurate. The property cannot be set on a backend for which confidentiality is not enabled.

Advanced Property::
No

Read-only::
No


====

index-entry-limit::
[open]
====
Description::
Specifies the maximum number of entries that are allowed to match a given index key before that particular index key is no longer maintained. This is analogous to the ALL IDs threshold in the Sun Java System Directory Server. If this is specified, its value overrides the JE backend-wide configuration. For no limit, use 0 for the value.


Default Value::
4000


Allowed Values::
An integer value. Lower value is 0. Upper value is 2147483647.


Multi-valued::
No

Required::
No

Admin Action Required::
If any index keys have already reached this limit, indexes must be rebuilt before they will be allowed to use the new limit.

Advanced Property::
No

Read-only::
No


====

index-extensible-matching-rule::
[open]
====
Description::
The extensible matching rule in an extensible index. An extensible matching rule must be specified using either LOCALE or OID of the matching rule.


Default Value::
No extensible matching rules will be indexed.


Allowed Values::
A Locale or an OID.


Multi-valued::
Yes

Required::
No

Admin Action Required::
The index must be rebuilt before it will reflect the new value.

Advanced Property::
No

Read-only::
No


====

index-type::
[open]
====
Description::
Specifies the type(s) of indexing that should be performed for the associated attribute. For equality, presence, and substring index types, the associated attribute type must have a corresponding matching rule.


Default Value::
None


Allowed Values::


approximate::
This index type is used to improve the efficiency of searches using approximate matching search filters.

equality::
This index type is used to improve the efficiency of searches using equality search filters.

extensible::
This index type is used to improve the efficiency of searches using extensible matching search filters.

ordering::
This index type is used to improve the efficiency of searches using "greater than or equal to" or "less then or equal to" search filters.

presence::
This index type is used to improve the efficiency of searches using the presence search filters.

substring::
This index type is used to improve the efficiency of searches using substring search filters.



Multi-valued::
Yes

Required::
Yes

Admin Action Required::
If any new index types are added for an attribute, and values for that attribute already exist in the database, the index must be rebuilt before it will be accurate.

Advanced Property::
No

Read-only::
No


====

substring-length::
[open]
====
Description::
The length of substrings in a substring index. 


Default Value::
6


Allowed Values::
An integer value. Lower value is 3.


Multi-valued::
No

Required::
No

Admin Action Required::
The index must be rebuilt before it will reflect the new value.

Advanced Property::
Yes (Use --advanced in interactive mode.)

Read-only::
No
